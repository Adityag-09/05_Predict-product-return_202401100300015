# 05_Predict-product-return_202401100300015
This project focuses on predicting product returns in the e-commerce industry, aiming to identify key factors that influence return behavior. With the growing challenge of managing returns, businesses need better ways to anticipate which products are likely to be returned. The goal of this analysis is to develop a predictive model that can help e-commerce platforms minimize returns and optimize their processes.

To achieve this, we analyze historical transaction data, which includes customer details, product features, purchasing behavior, and return history. Key factors such as product type, price, customer demographics, and previous return behavior are considered in the analysis. By applying machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like random forests, we build models that can predict whether a product is likely to be returned after purchase.
